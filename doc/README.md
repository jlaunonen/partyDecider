To generate images, get [Plantuml compiled Jar](https://plantuml.com/)
or use relevant IDE plugin to view the images directly from `.puml` file.
The compiled Jar can usually be run by "double-clicking", or with command like `java -jar plantuml*.jar`.
The tool will not display the images, but generate them into same directory as `.puml` file.
